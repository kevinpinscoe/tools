# Tools

This repository collects small tools and automation scripts I have created for Linux, macOS, and Raspberry Pi systems.

Some of these scripts are also referenced from my playbook, so I keep them here in one place for versioning, reuse, and maintenance.

Most of the top-level files are standalone utilities. The main structured subproject is [`rss-feed-generators/`](./rss-feed-generators), which contains self-contained RSS feed generator scripts and related notes.

## Top-level scripts

- `ddir` / `ddir.py` compares two directories recursively, reporting missing files and running side-by-side diffs on files that differ.
- `decode-tldr-tracking-links.sh` decodes TLDR newsletter tracking links so the underlying destination URL is easier to inspect.
- `find-in-ai.sh` searches Markdown notes in the current tree with `rg`.
- `find-obsidian-vaults` finds Obsidian vaults under `$HOME` by locating `.obsidian` directories.
- `jsonfmt` safely formats JSON and JSONC files in place.
- `obsidian-backup-this-vault.sh` creates timestamped backups of the current Obsidian vault and prunes older archives.
- `walk_thru_readme_and_find_missing_files.py` checks `README.md` files for local Markdown links that point to missing files.
- `walk_thru_repo_looking_for_files_missing_from_README.py` finds Markdown files in the repo that are not linked from a sibling `README.md`.

## Subprojects

- [`file-tools/`](./file-tools) contains tools for locating, searching, or manipulating files.
- [`rss-feed-generators/`](./rss-feed-generators) contains self-contained RSS feed generator scripts and related notes.
